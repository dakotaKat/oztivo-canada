# oztivo-canada
OzTiVo/TiVo Canada files from a long lost time. These were files used to run TiVos in countries that didn't have support for the OG Series 1 at launch (specifically, Australia, and then Canada).

All code is from the original creators from the OzTivo and TiVo Canada projects, as it was from the TiVo Canada CVS long ago.
