CHANGELOG 0.06	- Limited number of credit roles parsed from the XML.
		- Added parsing for <stereo>, <aspect> and <subtitles>.
		- Implemented a wincy patch to writeguide.c
		- Implemented a tivoDate to struct tm function.

CHANGELOG 0.05	- Implemented two seriesPair tables, one table for those
		  seriesPairs found during previous slice-writing and
		  another table for those seriesPairs found during the
		  current XML parse. After the slice data is written out, the
		  two tables are merged and sorted, and then written out
		  to the SERIES_MAP_FILE.
		
		- Updated GENRE_MAP_FILE to include the all essential "Darts"
		  category, amongst a handful of other categories.

CHANGELOG 0.04	- Changed the names of a few functions. 
		- Moved initial file loading routines out of main()
		- Tidied up the GENRE_MAP_FILE ("Football" != "Soccer"
		  and "Movie/Drama" is a Drama rather than a Movie.)

CHANGELOG 0.03 	- Fixed stupid bug.. stationDayIndex was being incremented
		  after every program record, existing slices are OK, but
		  it was a wasteful use of index values.
		- Now provides warning if unknown category found in the XML.

CHANGELOG 0.02	- Fixed writing of stationDay records which were not being
		  dumped out in full. The relevant record write function was
		  in the wrong depth of a nested loop.

CHANGELOG 0.01	- Half-baked version
